Hi! My name is Celine Manigbas, and I’m passionate about advancing equitable healthcare through genetics research. I strive to leverage high-throughput genotyping and biobank data to address health disparities in underserved populations. My goal is to bridge gaps in genetic research by exploring genome-wide screening approaches, enriching genetics with diverse perspectives, and fostering inclusion in genomics.

As a Bioinformatician in [Dr. Andrew Sharp's lab](https://profiles.mountsinai.org/andrew-j-sharp) at the [Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/genomics/about) (ISMMS) since August 2022, I’ve led large-scale genome-wide analyses of tandem repeat (TR) variation, a multi-allelic variant largely ignored in standard genetic studies. Despite advances in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) repositories— which predominantly focus on binary variants—SNPs cannot account for the heritability of complex traits, known as the “missing heritability” problem in genetics. A candidate for addressing this problem is TRs. 

In our most recent [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-54678-0), we revealed that a subset of TRs are indeed causal, likely impacting local gene expression and DNA methylation as the mechanism of action. Of note, I discovered a novel association between a coding repeat in *HRCT1* and high blood pressure, further confirmed by associating the repeat’s allele length to aorta tissue expression. 

I envision a future where I not only to drive research that addresses pressing questions in genetics but also ensure that the insights we uncover empower diverse communities to achieve better health outcomes. My aim is to contribute meaningfully to a more equitable and inclusive era of genetic discovery.
