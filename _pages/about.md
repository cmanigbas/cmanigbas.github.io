Hi! My name is Celine Manigbas, and I work in the Sharp lab at the [Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/genomics/about). 

As a Bioinformatician in [Dr. Andrew Sharp's lab](https://profiles.mountsinai.org/andrew-j-sharp) at the ISMMS since August 2022, I’ve led large-scale genome-wide analyses of tandem repeat (TR) variation, a multi-allelic variant largely ignored in standard genetic studies. Despite advances in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) repositories— which predominantly focus on binary variants—SNPs cannot account for the heritability of complex traits, known as the “missing heritability” problem in genetics. A candidate for addressing this problem is TRs. 

In our most recent [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-54678-0), we revealed that a subset of TRs are indeed causal, likely impacting local gene expression and DNA methylation as the mechanism of action. Of note, I discovered a novel association between a coding repeat in *HRCT1* and high blood pressure, further confirmed by associating the repeat’s allele length to aorta tissue expression.
