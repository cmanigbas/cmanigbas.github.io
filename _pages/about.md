Hi! My name is Celine Manigbas, and I am a Bioinformatician in the Sharp lab at the [Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/genomics/about). 

My work in the [Sharp lab](https://profiles.mountsinai.org/andrew-j-sharp), focuses on identifying genetic variations, such as tandem repeats (TRs), and their associations with various human traits, utilizing large-scale biobank data for phenome-wide association studies.

In our most recent study, we identified 47 TRs associated with 73 traits and highlights novel associations linked to common TR length variations, emphasizing their role in impacting human traits and the "missing heritability" of the human genome.
