At the annual European Society of Human Genetics conference in Berlin, Germany, I had the privilege to present my research at a poster session. My abstract, titled "A phenome-wide association study of tandem repeat variation in 168,554 individuals from the UK Biobank", was ranked among the top submissions, earning me a place at the Best Posters Session. During this session, I presented a brief introduction to the project, followed by an additional highlighted poster presentation.
