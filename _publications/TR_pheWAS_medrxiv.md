SNP-based GWAS are a prevalent tool for identifying risk loci associated with human traits and diseases. However, most genetic association studies focus on binary variants, typically ignoring other variant types that could contribute to the “missing heritability” of the genome. We hypothesized that common length polymorphism of tandem repeats (TRs), a multi-allelic variant not assayed in standard genetic studies, can modulate phenotypic variation of human traits. To investigate this, we used direct genotypes for >50,000 TRs and performed phenome-wide association studies for >30,000 traits in 168,554 individuals of European ancestry with whole genome sequencing data from the UK Biobank.  

We identified 47 TRs that showed causal associations with 73 traits based on fine-mapping and conditional analysis. We replicated 23 of 31 (74%) of these causal associations with matching traits in the All of Us cohort. While this set included several known repeat expansion disorders, novel associations we identified were attributable to common polymorphic variation in TR length, rather than rare expansions. Causal TRs were strongly enriched for functional repeats that impact local gene expression and DNA methylation, supporting their causality and providing insights into the molecular mechanism by which TRs impact the associated phenotype.
